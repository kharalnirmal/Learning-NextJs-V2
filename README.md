# Next.js Learning Journey

This repository serves as a personal learning journey and comprehensive resource for mastering Next.js. Each significant topic or feature explored within Next.js is organized into its own dedicated branch, allowing for focused study and easy reference. The `main` branch remains clean and serves as a foundational starting point, while other branches delve into specific implementations and concepts.

## Learning Approach

This repository adopts a unique learning methodology where each core Next.js concept or feature is developed and isolated within its own Git branch. This approach offers several advantages:

-   **Focused Learning**: Each branch represents a single, digestible topic, making it easier to understand and experiment with specific Next.js functionalities without interference from other concepts.
-   **Clean `main` Branch**: The `main` branch is kept intentionally minimal, serving as a pristine starting point for new topics or as a reference for a basic Next.js setup. This ensures that the foundational project structure is always accessible and uncluttered.
-   **Version Control as a Learning Tool**: By utilizing branches, the evolution of understanding for each topic is clearly documented through commit history. This allows for easy review of how a feature was implemented step-by-step.
-   **Easy Comparison and Reference**: Developers can easily switch between branches to compare different implementations, understand the impact of various configurations, or quickly reference how a particular feature is integrated.

To explore a specific topic, simply check out its corresponding branch. For example, to learn about API Routes, you would switch to the `api-routes` branch.




## Topics Covered

Each Next.js topic or feature explored in this learning journey resides in its own dedicated Git branch. To see the list of all available topics (branches), you can use the following Git command in your terminal:

```bash
git branch -a
```

This command will list all local and remote branches, allowing you to identify the specific topics covered. The `main` branch is kept clean and serves as a foundational starting point.

As the learning journey progresses, new branches will be added to cover additional Next.js features and best practices.




## Getting Started

To explore the Next.js concepts within this repository, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kharalnirmal/Learning-NextJs-V2.git
    cd Learning-NextJs-V2
    ```

2.  **Switch to a topic branch**:

    To view a specific topic, switch to its corresponding branch. For example, to explore API Routes:

    ```bash
    git checkout api-routes
    ```

    You can see all available branches using `git branch -a`.

3.  **Install dependencies**:

    Once on a branch, install the necessary Node.js packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server**:

    After installing dependencies, start the Next.js development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. The application will auto-update as you make changes.





## Contributing

Contributions to this learning repository are highly encouraged! If you'd like to add a new topic, improve an existing example, or fix a bug, please follow these guidelines:
